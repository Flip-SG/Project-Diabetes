# Project-Diabetes
Personal project that analyzes a Kaggle dataset


## Dataset

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. 
Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their Body Mass 
Index - BMI, insulin level, age, blood pressure, skin thickness, glucose and Diabetes Pedigree 
Function. The dataset can be found in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)


## Project Overview

At first, I will analyze the correlation of the input variables with the output variable. 
Which predictor variable (Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, 
Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age) has the strongest correlated with diabetes?
